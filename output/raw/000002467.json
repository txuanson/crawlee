If you are between two even sizes, take the middle size (for example: a 8-10 would be a true size 9). That is then your starting point for every pair. Judy Blue jeans are very stretchy compared to other brands. We recommend sizing down one size in most cases.", "Fit for Bootcut - Sizes 1-15: For fitted look, size down 1 from your odd size, PLUS: For a realxed fit - go true to size, for a fitted waist - size down 1.", "These Judy Blue Mid Rise Light Wash Bootcut denim Jeans are your classic bootcut jeans that are staple in your wardrobe.

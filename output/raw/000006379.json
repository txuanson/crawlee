At every temperature level, Cyclonic Wave circulates heat in ultra-efficient 3D waves for easier food preparation, even with denser, more complex food textures. Inverter Technology delivers a constant stream of cooking power at every temperature for more evenly cooked meals, edges to center. With the touch of the Genius Sensor button, this microwave takes the guesswork out of creating a great meal by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking or defrosting time. The sensor measures the amount of steam produced during cooking and calculates remaining cooking time at the appropriate power level. A selection of 14 auto cook options helps quickly prepare favorite foods, like pizza, popcorn, pasta, soup, oatmeal and other dishes. The Panasonic NN-SN76LS has a spacious 1.6 cu.ft. capacity, but takes up minimal counter space."]}

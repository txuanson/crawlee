It operates at a higher temperature than dishwashers, using the power of the microwave oven to create natural steam. Measuring just 6.54 tall by 11.07 inches long, it is small enough to fit in most microwave ovens. Its compact, lightweight design makes it ideal for use when traveling. Safety clips keep the lid securely fastened to the base, and side grips stay cooler than the rest of the sterilizer for safe handling in and out of the microwave. At full capacity, the Microwave Steam Sterilizer holds up to four 9 ounce or two 11 ounce Philips Avent bottles. An interior rack can also hold two Philips Avent breast pumps (non-electrical parts only) and up to four breast milk storage cups with lids. You can also use it to sterilize pacifiers, non-metal utensils and other microwave-safe baby items. If the lid is unopened, contents will remain sterile and ready for their next use for up to 24 hours. The Philips Avent Microwave Steam Sterilizer is BPA free. "]}

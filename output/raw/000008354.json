Two spacious file drawers open on smooth full-extension ball bearing slides for an effortless reach to all your letter, legal, and A4-size paperwork. Each drawer can support up to 60 pounds of materials. The height of the 2 Drawer File Cabinet matches that of coordinating Cabot Computer Desks to offer an extended work surface when placed side by side. The innovative Open-Safe Drawers are designed to pull out one at a time for improved stability on both hard and carpeted floors. Stylish metal hardware complements your choice of several traditional and contemporary finish options for an appearance that works with your own space and taste. This lateral filing cabinet has been rigorously tested to meet or exceed ANSI/SOHO quality standards for safety and performance and is backed by the Bush Furniture 1 Year Manufacturer's Warranty. See the full Cabot Collection for coordinating items to complete your transitional workspace, including desks, chairs, storage cabinets, bookcases, and more (sold separately)."]}

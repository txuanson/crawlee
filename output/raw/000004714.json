Explosion-proof design, fast, reliable and stable; explosion-proof grade Ex d II CT6 Full software auto-calibration function, the machine is equipped with standard three keys to achieve single person single point on-site maintenance. Monitoring the gas concentration in the environment or pipeline, full software auto-calibration function, zero calibration function, make gas monitoring more accurate and reliable. With temperature compensation, it can perfectly realise the compensation of gas concentration under different ambient temperatures. Infrared remote control can be remote non-open cover to achieve the alarm point setting, zero calibration, modify the address and other functions. One or two switching signals can be output to drive external devices such as exhaust fans or solenoid valves.

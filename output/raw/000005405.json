Introducing Acer's Nitro KG271U gaming monitor - the WQHD resolution monitor that can keep up with your game play.

Plus, users can enjoy comfortable viewing experience while gaming via flicker-less, low dimming and ComfyView display. The design saves space on your desk and lets you place multiple monitors side by side to build a seamless big-screen display. (UM.HX1AA.X01)."]}

Featuring a removable, tray-style drawer for small items like sticky notes and paper clip boxes, a box shelf for notebooks, documents and your mobile device, and an easy-access pen and pencil tray right up front, the Onyx Mounted Hanging Storage Unit lets you keep your most important office tools close at hand but off your desktop, helping to promote a cleaner, more organized work area. With a lightweight but sturdy steel wire and mesh construction and scratch-resistant black powder coat finish, the Onyx Mounted Under-Desk Storage Unit offers long-lasting durability in a variety of active office environments. Attach the Onyx Hanging Storage Unit to the underside of your desktop or table using the four included screws - you'll need to drill a.5\"-deep pilot hole into the desktop for each one. Minimum Desktop Thickness:.75\". Drill and 5 64\" drill bit required for installation. Become the most organized person in your office by adding even more streamlined storage solutions from Safeco's Onyx Series, like the Triple Tray Desktop Organizer or the Rolling File Cube (each sold separately).

Your creations will be the envy of all who see them! 1/2 inch shank for stability. Super tough C3 carbide for longer cutter life. Teflon coating for heat resistance. Anti-kickback design for safety. Caution: These are large bits and should be used on router tables and shapers with 2 1/4 horsepower or more. Keep RPMs below 12,000. Do not try to use it with a handheld router.

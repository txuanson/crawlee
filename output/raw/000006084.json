Featuring Automatic exposure and Flash control, the INSTAX WIDE 400 instant camera takes high-quality images, while you focus on filling the wide frame to perfection. With the INSTAX WIDE 400 instant camera\u2019s iconic analog-style Self-timer lever, the whole group can fit in the shot. By rotating the dial, you can set two second increments of up to ten seconds, press the shutter button and pose until the magic happens (with the LED countdown, it\u2019s easy to keep track of the time). To get that perfect angle, the INSTAX WIDE 400 instant camera comes with a Camera angle adjustment accessory. With its two height options you can pick the angle you want, slide the Camera angle adjustment accessory under the camera into the custom-fit space, set the Self-timer and step back into the frame. Rotate the lens dial to seamlessly turn the camera on and off and switch between Focus Modes. Normal Mode is your go-to for those everyday must-haves, Landscape Mode is perfect for beautiful landscape shots, and close-ups are easy to take with the included Close-up lens, putting you right in the heart of the action. Shooting wide shots should be easy! That\u2019s why the INSTAX WIDE 400 instant camera has two easy-to-use framing guides. Look through the viewfinder and you\u2019ll see one for normal and landscape shots, and one for close-up images, both designed to help you compose your image. So, when adventure calls, go wide. The understated Green colored body makes the INSTAX WIDE 400 instant camera look ready for action, complete with the included Shoulder strap, to keep your camera easily at hand, when on the go. There\u2019s even a built-in tripod mount (tripod sold separately) for those who love to journal with photos."]}

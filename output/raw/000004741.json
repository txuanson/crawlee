After following hard to understand drawings from books and the internet I decided to design and build my own sheds. I use the latest building practices and AutoCAD software to design these. This is for a 10' X 20' Saltbox shed. I like the size and design. I have included a Bill of Materials to make for easy shopping. All DIY plans are designed or reviewed by Ben Stone. Ben is a retired Engineer in Canada. Ben also drafts these himself using the latest AutoCAD software to ensure accuracy. He studied Engineering back in the early 1980s. After over 30 years in the Construction industry, he developed a passion for building cool items around his farm and cabin. These are great DIY projects. With a little skill, anybody can Do It Yourself. Ben is always an email away if you have any questions while building one of his projects. He is adding new plans all the time."]}

Introducing Acer's KG241Y gaming monitor - the Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution monitor that can keep up with your game play. Through AMD FreeSync Premium technology, the game\u2019s frame rate is determined by your graphics card, not the fixed refresh rate of the monitor, giving you a serious competitive edge. Plus, users can enjoy comfortable viewing experience while gaming via flicker-less, low dimming and ComfyView display. The design saves space on your desk and lets you place multiple monitors side by side to build a seamless big-screen display. (UM.QX1AA.303)"]}

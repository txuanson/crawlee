AMD Radeon FreeSync\u2122 keeps the monitor and graphics card refresh rate in sync, reducing image tearing for seamless, smooth scenes. Black Equalizer allows you to adjust dark areas in games, letting you spot your enemies in even the darkest hiding nooks. Eye Saver Mode minimizes blue light and reduces irritating screen flicker for more comfortable gaming, and the 3-sided borderless design provides maximum space for bigger, bolder gameplay, enabling a precise dual-monitor setup. Features an ergonomic stand to adjust your monitor height for optimal comfort when playing for extended periods of time. ", "\u00b9\"1 ms\" means one millisecond which is the range of avg. response time between 1.00ms to 1.99ms truncated to a whole number. Based on MPRT measured under internal test conditions. Results may vary by content and monitor settings (requires \u2018Extreme mode' setting). MPRT (Moving Picture Response Time) measures the time taken for a pixel to transition from one image frame to another (motion blur measurement). Refresh rate may vary by content and input source. \u00b2Images simulated for illustrative purposes."]}

These mid-rise jeans sit right below the belly button, and the high-waisted design creates a flattering silhouette. The 9.75-inch front rise and 13.75-inch back rise make these jeans easy to wear all day long. The stretch denim fabric provides comfort and flexibility, so you can move freely throughout your day. The classic 5-pocket design adds a touch of style, and the dark wash finish gives these jeans a versatile look that can be dressed up or down. Whether you're running errands or going out on the town, these jeans will keep you looking and feeling your best. Please note that these jeans run true to size, but some customers have reported that they run a bit small. We recommend ordering one size up if you're between sizes or if you prefer a more relaxed fit."]}

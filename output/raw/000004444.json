Tracks transactions in a check register. Print reports, Reconcile bank statement. Export to QIF, CSV or Tab files. Print on pre-printed checks in some cases (must match one of our templates, be in sheet form 8.5x11, business checks perfed at 3.5\", wallet perfed at 2.87\" - Contact us for more info). Requirements: High quality printer; Bank compatible blank check paper; MICR ink or toner* FOR U.S. BANKS ONLY. For questions, feel free to contact us. Note: the program does not interface with other software, so completing with other finance software is a 2-step process. This is NOT a payroll program. Ships on a CD. Check paper not included. *Official bank recommendation. Many banks have optical readers that don't need magnetic ink, though some still have the older-style magnetic readers. Many don't use MICR toner with no problem. Your experience may vary."]}

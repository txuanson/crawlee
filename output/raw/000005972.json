Not only is this iconic instant camera available in five super cute and appealing tones \u2013 Pastel Blue, Mint Green, Blossom Pink, Lilac Purple and Clay White \u2013 it\u2019s fully loaded with easy-to-use modes and controls. Designed to keep up with life, the INSTAX MINI 12\u2122 instant camera is ready to go with a simple twist of the lens. Twist again and you\u2019re in Close-up mode, perfect for selfies. Combined with the perfectly positioned selfie mirror, automatic flash control and INSTAX MINI instant photos, the INSTAX MINI 12 instant camera is a selfie extraordinaire. But that\u2019s not all the Close-up mode can do. When activated, the viewfinder neatly pairs up with the lens, so what you see is what you get \u2013 no object shifts in your final INSTAX photo! (FYI the fancy term for this is parallax correction.) Because when you\u2019re this close, there\u2019s no room for error. Plus, with automatic exposure, you can simply aim and click. No need to adjust any settings, just simply fun photos every time. And with that in mind, once you have snapped, your INSTAX MINI instant photo will eject in approximately five seconds (development time thereafter is approximately 90 seconds). All without compromising on image quality. That deserves high fives all around. When you\u2019re finished capturing memories, twist the lens again to turn the INSTAX MINI 12 instant camera off. But the fun doesn\u2019t end there. Download the free INSTAX UP!\u2122 App to your Smartphone for a new way to keep all your INSTAX photos digitally, in one place. All you have to do is use the INSTAX UP! App and your Smartphone to scan your printed INSTAX photos and they\u2019ll be turned into sharable, digital photos that you can edit, tag and save. Ready to twist & go?"]}

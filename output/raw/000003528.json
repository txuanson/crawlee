Choose a high-quality dog food that's specially crafted with the unique needs of your small dog in mind. Rachael Ray Nutrish Little Bites Small Breed Dry Dog Food, Real Chicken & Veggies Recipe is not only inspired by Rachael's kitchen (for a taste your fur baby is sure to enjoy). It's also a wholesome, chicken first dog food \u2014 made with carefully selected ingredients for the nutrition needed to help your little bud be small, but mighty! REAL CHICKEN, the #1 ingredient, helps support healthy organs and build lean muscle mass. PEAS & CARROTS are sources of fiber, which helps support healthy digestion. BROWN RICE is a highly digestible carbohydrate that's low in fat but high in fiber. It helps support healthy digestion while also providing your dog with a source of energy. CHICKEN FAT is a naturally rich source of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, which help support skin and coat health. Know what's NOT in this premium dog food? Poultry by-product meal or artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.

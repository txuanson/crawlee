The number one ingredient in this dry dog food is real beef, which helps support healthy organs and maintain lean muscle mass, while fiber sources including peas and brown rice help support healthy digestion. We\u2019ve also added our Whole Health Blend, which includes omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil to help support an active mind, antioxidants like those found in superfoods to help support a healthy body, and whole grains to help maintain balanced energy levels. And it does all that with no fillers, no artificial flavors and no artificial preservatives. Plus, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of every Nutrish dog food product will be donated to The Rachael Ray Foundation, which helps animals in need. So, get a bag and make your dog the happiest one on the block."]}

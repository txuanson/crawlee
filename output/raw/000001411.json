Head Designer Pierre Morisset pioneered this method as he sought to recreate the jeans of a passing motorcyclist, which had moulded to his legs from longtime exposure to the elements. With angled seams, workwear pockets, and reinforced knees, these jeans are designed for elevated style and function. Not only do they look and feel great, but you can also wear them with confidence knowing they\u2019re made with recycled polyester and sustainable cotton from the Better Cotton Initiative, which reduces their environmental impact. A fitted waistband and skinny pant legs allow our jeans for men to easily form to your body while the zipper closure adds convenience. G-Star Raw\u2019s 5620 3D Skinny Fit Jeans are machine washable; do not bleach."]}

Powered by Google Tensor G2, it\u2019s fast and secure, with an immersive display and amazing battery life. It features the best Pixel camera yet, with a telephoto lens and pro-level features like Macro Focus, Cinematic Blur, and more. Plus, it\u2019s Pixel\u2019s most refined design, made with recycled materials.[20] LEGAL [1]Compared to Pixel 6. Speed and power efficiency claims based on internal testing on pre-production devices. [2]Works with all major carriers. 5G service is carrier dependent. Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service not available on all carrier networks or in all areas. Contact carrier for details. 5G service, speed, and performance depend on many factors, including carrier network capabilities and signal strength. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply. See g.co/pixel/networkinfo for info. [3]For \u201cover 24 hours\u201d: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 31 hours. Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For \u201cUp to 72 hours\u201d: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For both claims: Battery testing conducted in California in mid 2022 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that, for the \u201cup to 72 hours\u201d claim only, Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower.

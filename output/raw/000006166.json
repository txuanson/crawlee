The 20-1200mm zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 20-1200mm) gives you the ability to shoot landscapes and panoramas with a high level of detail. The FZ80D handles up-close shots as well as it handles landscapes, with macro shooting at minimum focusing distance of 1cm for detailed close-up shots of food, flowers, insects, and more. The 2,360K-dot View Finder is designed to give you a clear, glare-resistant view at all times, even in bright sunlight. Enjoy clear, precise videos and photos, even action shots, with 4K Video Mode, recording up to 4x resolution of Full HD; the 4K Photo feature lets you extract the perfect photo out of 4K video and save it as an 8-megapixel equivalent still image. Not sure where to focus? Post-Focus feature gives you the power to touch the area you'd like to focus in on, even after the shot has been taken. You'll never worry about blur with POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) to minimize hand shake."]}

Requires initial set up of 10 minutes of outside running with GPS on; smartphone with Android 8.0 or later, 1.5GB or more RAM and Samsung Health app version 6.22 or later. ***Phone must be within 2 feet of user with snore detection enabled through Samsung Health app version 6.22 or later. ****Requires Samsung Galaxy Smartphone with Android 7.0 or later, and Samsung Health Monitor app (available only at the Samsung Galaxy app store). The ECG Monitor App intended for adults 22 years and older analyzes pulse rate data to identify episodes of irregular heart rhythms suggestive of AFib and provides a notification suggesting the user record an ECG to analyze the heart rhythm. The IHRN feature is not intended to provide a notification on every episode of irregular rhythm suggestive of AFib and the absence of a notification is not intended to indicate no disease process is present; rather the feature is intended to opportunistically acquire pulse rate data when the user is still and analyze the data when determined sufficient toward surfacing a notification. The ECG Monitor App is not intended to replace traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment. The ECG app is not intended for users with known arrhythmias other than AFib or users under 22 years old. Users should not interpret or take clinical action based on the device output without consultation of a qualified healthcare professional. *****The Samsung BIA is a body analyzer that uses bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) technology to track body composition based on weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle, body water, and basal metabolic rate (BMR) measurements. It is not intended to specifically diagnose or treat a medical condition. ******Compatibility for Galaxy wearable apps: Android 8.0 or later, 1.5GB of RAM. *******44mm Galaxy Watch6 model only. ********Select interchangeable watch bands sold separately."]}
